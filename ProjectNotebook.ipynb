    "\n",
    "Disney villains are some of the most interesting and colorful characters out there, and not only do they make or break a movie, but they are almost always what the audience remembers long after the first watch. Though these villains may have a few general motivations in common, each one is unique with distinctive personality traits that add to the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I wanted to create a personality quiz that tells you which classic villain you have the most in common with. From pet peeves to picking sidekicks, this quiz asks you to imagine yourself as the antagonist, and embrace the wicked lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hope you have fun exploring your dark side and make sure to answer with the capitalized letter of your choice!"
